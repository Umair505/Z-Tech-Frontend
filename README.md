    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL="YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL" # e.g., https://api.z-tech.com
    ```
    Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials and your backend server URL.

4.  **Run the development server:**

*   **Profile & Wishlist**: Manage your personal information and view your saved products on the `/profile` and `/wishlist` pages, respectively.
*   **Admin Dashboard**: If you have administrator privileges, access the dashboard at `/dashboard`. From here, you can:
    *   Add new products: `/dashboard/add-product`
    *   View and manage existing products: `/dashboard/products`
